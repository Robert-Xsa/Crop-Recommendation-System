 Crop recommendation system is a type of technology that utilizes data and algorithms to provide farmers with personalized advice on which crops to grow based on various factors such as climate, soil conditions, and other relevant parameters. These systems aim to optimize agricultural productivity by suggesting crops that are well-suited to the specific conditions of a given farm or region.

Crop recommendation systems can contribute to sustainable agriculture by helping farmers make informed decisions that optimize resource use, reduce environmental impact, and improve overall yield and profitability. These systems leverage advancements in data science, machine learning, and agricultural technology to enhance decision-making in farming practices.
